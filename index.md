## Welcome to PGSQL

PG uses a variant of L&Y algorithm for concurrent access to B-tree, which is also referred as BLink-tree. Specifically, L&Y requires a B-tree to have:
- A high-key for each page and it's greater than or equal to each tuple on that page. This high-key is only for pivot purpose when trying to find a tuple greater than any element on that page, we know that the page has been split so that we should move right.
- A **next** link to the right sibling, not only for the page split mentioned in above case, but also can be used for range scan.

In addition to that, PG also have a **prev** link to the left sibling for reverse scan.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
